Started studying for the TOEIC today.
Took a practice test alone—scored 480.
Feels like an honest reflection of where I am now.

Began reading "The Promise of Giants".
It's about leadership.
Metacognition was mentioned in the book.
It's a topic I’ve been into lately.

Still thinking about what it means to be a leader.

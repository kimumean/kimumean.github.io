Started studying for the TOEIC today.  
Took a practice test-scored 480.  
Feels like an honest reflection of where I am now.

Began reading *The Promise of Giants*.  
Metacognition came up, so I made a note.  
It's a topic Iâ€™ve been into lately.

Still thinking about what it means to be a leader.
